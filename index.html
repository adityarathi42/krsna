      <h3><b>WHO AM I? </b><br></h3>
       <p> What am I? Am I the body, mind or something more? Am I this body, or am I spiritual? The soul is a particle of consciousness and bliss in its purified state of being. It is not material in any way. It is what departs from the body at the time of death and, in the subtle body, carries its mental impressions, desires and tendencies, along with the karmic results of its activities from one body to another. To understand and perceive this self, which is our genuine spiritual identity, is the real goal of life. Such a realization relieves one of further material existence. </p> <br>
       <h3><b>WHO IS KRISHNA? </b></h3>
       <p>The immediate answer is that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How is that? Because He conforms in exact detail to descriptions of the Supreme Being, the Godhead. In other words, Krishna is the Godhead because He is all-attractive. There are three forms of Krishna: </p>
        <p class="left"> <ul>
          <li>Universe: Impersonal form</li>
          <li>Localised Supersoul</li>
          <li>Personal Form</li>
        </ul> </p>
        <h3><b>WHAT IS KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS?</b></h3>
        <p> Krishna consciousness means God consciousness. Jesus, or anyone who speaks about God, is in Krishna consciousness. But one must know the science, and within that science there are degrees of knowledge. One person may know to one extent, another may know to a greater extent, another may know to an even greater extent. "Krishna consciousness" means complete understanding of Krishna.</p> <br>

        <h3><b>WHO IS LORD CHAITANYA?</b></h3>
        <p>Lord Chaitanya is Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I, along with many thousands of other Westerners, have come to accept this conclusion from the great spiritual master of the Krishna consciousness movement in the modern age, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who has done more than anyone else to spread the teachings of Lord Chaitanya all over the world</p> <br>

        <h3><b>WHAT IS HARE KRISHNA MOVEMENT?</b></h3>
        <p>525 years ago Krishna appeared as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the form of His own devotee to establish the congregational chanting of God's holy names, sankirtana, as the easiest and most sublime spiritual practice for this age. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu popularized the chanting of the maha-mantra, comprised of sacred names of God: <br> <br>
          <i><b>Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare <br> Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</b></i></p> <br>

          <h3><b>WHAT IS SELF REALIZATION?</b></h3>
          <p>If one wants to make steady progress on the path of self-realization, he must try to control the forces of the material senses. 
          There are the forces of talk, forces of anger, forces of mind, forces of the stomach, forces of the genitals, and forces of the tongue. 
        One who is able to control the forces of all these different senses, and the mind, is called gosvāmī, or svāmī. Such gosvāmīs live strictly controlled lives, and forgo altogether the forces of the senses. Material desires, when unsatiated, generate anger, and thus the mind, eyes and chest become agitated. Therefore, one must practice to control them before one gives up this material body. One who can do this is understood to be self-realized and is thus happy in the state of self-realization. It is the duty of the transcendentalist to try strenuously to control desire and anger.</p><br>
